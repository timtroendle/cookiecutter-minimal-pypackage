# cookiecutter-minimal-pypackage

This repository provides a [cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template for a minimal pypackage living on GitHub. It does not attempt to be generic, but has a clear and opinionated focus. Use this if you are not planning to deploy the package in the near future.

Packages build with this template use `Python 3`, `pytest`, `GitHub`, and `Travis`. Fork, clone, or download this repository on GitHub if you want to change any of these.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have cookiecutter installed, otherwise install it:

    pip install cookiecutter

Then create a repository using:

    cookiecutter gh:timtroendle/cookiecutter-minimal-pypackage

## License

Parts if this template are inspired by [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage). This template is MIT licensed itself.
