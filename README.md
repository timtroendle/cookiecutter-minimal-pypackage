# cookiecutter-focussed-pypackage

This repository provides a [cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template for a focussed pypackage living on GitHub. It does not attempt to be generic, but has a clear and opinionated focus.

Packages build with this template use `Python 3`, `conda`, `Travis`, and `pytest`. Fork, clone, or download this repository on GitHub if you want to change any of these.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have cookiecutter installed, otherwise install it with [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html):

    conda install cookiecutter -c conda-forge

Then create a repository using:

    cookiecutter gh:timtroendle/cookiecutter-focussed-pypackage
